### Mission

The goal for the beginner's guide is to create materials that encourage people to learn and build amazing things. Only when we give everyone the tools to learn and create will the internet be diverse and bias free. With this guide, I hope to create an inclusive environment where those interested in developing their programming skills can learn in a safe, open space, while providing the same mentorship style that SparkBox and GDI have offered me.

### Project Based Environment

This beginners guide includes the following topics: Git & GitHub, Dotfiles, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Accessibility, and WordPress. Each section contains a brief summary of the subtopics, a list of external resources I have used and found the most helpful, a small cheat sheet, and project prompts.
Each prompt is a project that I have completed myself, and in the process of during so learned a lot about web development.
