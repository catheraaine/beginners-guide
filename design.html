                Git is a
                <strong>version control system used on the command line</strong> so developers can keep track of all the code changes
                they make to a project. It also allows developers to
                <strong>collaborate</strong>. Instead of having to email code back and forth, people can download the latest version
                of a project and keep track of the revisions they make to the code. There are other version control systems,
                but Git is the most popular.

                When working with git and any service like GitHub be aware of
                <strong>ReadMe, Pull Requests, and Commit Messages.</strong>

                        <strong>Readme</strong>, often seen as README.md, uses the markdown syntax and contains documentation about
                        repos. Always include one in any repo you make.

                        <strong>Pull Requests</strong> are used with teams and open source communities. On GitHub it is seen on of
                        the top tabs under the repos name. Pull Requests are used to show other developers code you have
                        added or changed to a repo. After adding code to your forked version of the repo, go to the original
                        repo, and use the Pull Request button to submit your changed code.

                        <strong>Commit Messages</strong> are messages you write in the terminal once you have added files to your

                        <code class="subject__p-list-item-code">git add [file]</code>. Use the command
                        <code class="subject__p-list-item-code">git commit -m "put text in single or double quotes"</code> This message will show up in your repo
                        so you know when you made what changes. To make a multi-line message, simple press enter before closing
                        the quotes.
